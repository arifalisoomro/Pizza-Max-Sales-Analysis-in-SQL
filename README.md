# Pizza Max Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of pizza sales for Pizza Max using SQL. The analysis uncovers valuable insights into sales patterns, revenue generation, and customer preferences.

## Data Sources
The analysis is based on four CSV files obtained from GitHub:
1. **Order Details**: Contains detailed information about each order.
2. **Orders**: Lists all orders placed.
3. **Pizzas**: Details of each pizza offered.
4. **Pizza Types**: Categories of pizzas available.

## Data Preparation
The data was imported into MySQL, and necessary tables were created for `orderdetails` and `orders` due to incorrect data types in the original CSV files. Data consistency and accuracy were ensured before conducting the analysis.

## Analysis Performed

### Basic Analysis
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

### Intermediate Analysis
1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### Advanced Analysis
1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
